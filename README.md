# Content-Based-Movie-Recommender-System
## This model relies on the similarity of the items being recommended.
## A content based recommender works with data that the user provides, either explicitly movie ratings for the MovieLens dataset. Based on that data, a user profile vector is generated, which is then used to make suggestions to the user.
## As the user provides more inputs or takes actions on the recommendations, the weighted average vector of user becomes more accurate thus giving more accurate recommendations when data feeded is more.
### Advantages : 
#### Learns user's preferences
#### Highly personalized for the user
### Disadvantages :
#### Low rated movie recommendation might occur if user choices were poor 
#### Only genres watched and rated by user will be recommended and new genres will be hidden
####  User profile vector is highly static as the movie watched by user is mostly based on user's mentality and not user's previous history
